# ODTF: one-class decision tree fuzzifier

Designed/created by FÃ©lix Iglesias, TU Wien (Feb 2018)

### Scripts:

- "odtfw.py" contains the one-class membership wrapper for decision trees.

- "memb_dist.py" calculates the distributions (with 10,50 and 90 quantiles/percentiles) of FNs, TNs, TPs and FPs.

###  Available data:

- The [knn] folder contains all data, configuration files and results for the experiments conducted in paper [1] related to the KDD-NSL dataset [2][3]. Data is already normalized, categorical removed and PCA transformed as explained in the paper.

- The [unsw] folder contains all data, configuration files and results for the experiments conducted in paper [1] related to the UNSW-NB15 dataset [4][5][6]. Data is already normalized, categorical removed and PCA transformed as explained in the paper.

###  Reproducing experiments:

Experiments from paper [1] can be reproduced with the following commands: 

**Warning: These operations will overwrite previous results stored in [out] subfolders!**

**Pre-step: Extract "test.csv" and "train.csv" files from "test.csv.zip" and "train.csv.zip" from the desired subfolder before running the scripts!**

To recalculate training data memberships, you can use the following commands for NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15:
```
> python odtfw.py kdd/config_num_norm_pca_train.txt

> python odtfw.py unsw/config_num_norm_pca_train.txt
```
