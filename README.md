# ODTF: one-class decision tree fuzzifier

Designed/created by FÃ©lix Iglesias, TU Wien (Feb 2018)

Refined/optimized by Matthias Katzengruber, TU Wien (May 2018) and FI (Sep 2018)

### Scripts:

- "odtfw.py" contains the one-class membership wrapper for decision trees.

- "memb_dist.py" calculates the distributions (with 10,50 and 90 quantiles/percentiles) of FNs, TNs, TPs and FPs.

- "addmembershipscore.py" adds membership scores to data as new predictors.


###  Available data:

- The [knn] folder contains all data, configuration files and results for the experiments conducted in paper [1] related to the KDD-NSL dataset [2][3]. Data is already normalized, categorical removed and PCA transformed as explained in the paper.

- The [unsw] folder contains all data, configuration files and results for the experiments conducted in paper [1] related to the UNSW-NB15 dataset [4][5][6]. Data is already normalized, categorical removed and PCA transformed as explained in the paper.

###  Reproducing experiments:

Experiments from paper [1] can be reproduced with the following commands: 

**Warning: These operations will overwrite previous results stored in [out] subfolders!**

```
> bash extract.sh

> bash ocdtfw_unsw_fullrun.sh > log_unsw.txt

> bash ocdtfw_kdd_fullrun.sh > log_kdd.txt
```
